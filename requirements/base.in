# Core requirements for using this application

# As this is an Open edX plugin, we rely on Open edX to define most of the
# requirements. It wouldn't help to specify them here again (ideally we
# could specify our assumptions and pip would warn us if the platform's
# pinned versions no longer match, but unfortunately doing that just causes
# pip to downgrade the package rather than displaying a version conflict
# error.)

# If any requirements in addition to those installed by Open edX are needed,
# specify them here (or in quality.in, test.in, etc.):
